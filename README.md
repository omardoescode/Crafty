# Crafty: A game engine for kids

This project is my implementation of [scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). I have chosen this project to hone my skills in multi-threaded programming, try more software engineering stuff, and have fun with C++ new features I am learning.

> [!CAUTION]
> This project is still under development.

# Features

1. End-User block Extensibility: One can extend the set of blocks available with some knowledge in json, and lua
2. Ease of Use: A developer can write another whole implementation of the interpreter that doesn't defy the abstract interface


# Dependencies
- opengl
- lua

*all other stuff are loaded via cmake*
# Usage

```sh
./build.sh crafty
./run.sh # a script to run it

```
